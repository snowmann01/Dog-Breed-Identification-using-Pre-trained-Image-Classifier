Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.
Answer-
VGG: Classified as "golden retriever"
RESNET: Classified as "golden retriever"
ALEXNET: Classified as "golden retriever"
All three model architectures classified Dog_01.jpg as the same breed.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.
Answer-
VGG: Both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg classified as "golden retriever"
RESNET: Both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg classified as "golden retriever"
ALEXNET: Both Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg classified as "golden retriever"
All three model architectures classified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.
Answer-
VGG: Misclassified Animal_Name_01.jpg as "tiger, panthera tigris", correctly classified Object_Name_01.jpg as "analog clock"
RESNET: Misclassified Animal_Name_01.jpg as "tiger, panthera tigris", correctly classified Object_Name_01.jpg as "analog clock"
ALEXNET: Misclassified Animal_Name_01.jpg as "tiger, panthera tigris", correctly classified Object_Name_01.jpg as "analog clock"
All three models correctly classified Object_Name_01.jpg as "analog clock" but misclassified Animal_Name_01.jpg.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.
Answer:
Selection: VGG, RESNET, and ALEXNET performed similarly in distinguishing dogs from non-dogs, achieving 100% accuracy in non-dog classifications. 
They all misclassified the breed of Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as "golden retriever".

Reasoning: Given their identical performance in this evaluation, choosing the best model would depend on other considerations like 
computational efficiency or specific application requirements.
